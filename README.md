# Task 2: Number Guessing Game

I have completed Task 2, which involved creating a short project called "Guess the Number" game. The game was developed using Swing for the graphical user interface and WindowBuilder for design assistance. In this game, players attempt to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. They have 5 guesses (or lives), with hints provided after each guess. If the player guesses the random number correctly, they earn 100 points; otherwise, they receive 5 points for each incorrect guess.
